# **About Me**
### I am a graduate student at the Department of Computer Science at Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea. I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University and am currently pursuing research in virtual reality, human-computer interaction, and reinforcement learning. I am passionate about developing immersive VR technologies to engage users in innovative ways. In my free time, I enjoy gourmet food, traveling, and yacht sailing. This is my CV ([download](./assets/CV.pdf)).
